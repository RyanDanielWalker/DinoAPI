//Business logic
//API
//call API for one word
//get word from response
//create an array using the word that was returned


//UI logic
//what are we doing with the word?
//user enters letter to guess
// display the proper amount of blank spaces in the DOM to correspond with the word
//create array of some sort to handle letter guessing
//how are we making the hangman?


for every index in indexArray we would takevalue of that and target that[i] of ansArrayaand then i = letter

  //bringing in the word from the API
  //populate the word in the UI
  // -> each DOM element (card or p or span) hidden - each with a class of their letter
  //user inputs a guess
  //check if the letter exists in the word
  //if it does, show every letter of that class
//otherwise display incorrect letter somewhere
//-> draw a piece of the hangman
  //keep track of what letters have been correctly guessed to determine if they win
  // -> check to see if any of them are still hidden
